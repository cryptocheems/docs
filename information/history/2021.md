## February

### The beginning of Cheemscoin

The idea of Cheemscoin first started on a r/dogelore post, where the founder of the coin, [suggested that he could actually create a real token.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogelore/comments/lcwgj7/all\_new\_and\_innovative\_idea/gm3j0zj/) A few days after, the contract for the token was deployed to the xDai Chain, a chain based on the USD stablecoin Dai that provides low fees. The coin was minted with the maximum supply of 690,420, and is burnable. In the next few days, a Discord server and subreddit was made for it, where fans could talk about the coin and its future.

### Listing on exchanges

On Feburary 6th, the same day the token was minted, it was listed on Honeyswap, the biggest xDai exchange at 1 cent per Cheems. A few days after, it was added to the official Honeyswap token list, making it easier for anyone to buy it, as you didn't have to type the address to make it show up anymore.

## July

### The beginnings of Farming

In July, the major events that happened for Cheemscoin was the launch of a testing version of farming. This system is more efficient than the previous folding system, where you had to leave your computer on for it to do the work needed. Now, you just deposit your LP tokens from various sources and you will earn, even when you turn off your computer.
