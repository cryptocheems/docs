# Rewards Calculation

The amount of Cheemscoin you will receive is in proportion to the number of LP tokens you deposited multiplied by the multiplier you chose compared to the amount of LP tokens other people deposited multiplied by the multipliers they chose. Essentially, you will get more Cheemscoin if you deposit more and/or other people deposit less.

After you make a deposit, you can "harvest" your Cheemscoin rewards whenever you want but you cannot withdraw your LP tokens until the lock duration has passed. Note that after the lock duration has passed the multiplier will be set to 1x. If you want a higher multiplier, you must withdraw and redeposit.

The APR that's shown on the website should only be used as a rough estimate of the reward rate if it was extrapolated over a year. Note that in reality the rewards will only be available until \[end date]. It is calculated...

Let's say there are currently 4 LP tokens desposited in the pool and the pool receives 40 Cheemscoin per day...
